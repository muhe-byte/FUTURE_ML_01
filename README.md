AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard businesses transition from reactive to proactive decision-making by forecasting future sales trends using historical transaction data [Retail Sales Forecasting data]
This project was developed during my Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns. The goal is to help retail businesses transition from reactive to proactive decision-making by forecasting future sales trends using historical transaction data.

The project combines Time Series Forecasting with Business Intelligence to provide actionable insights for inventory management and sales strategy.

🛠️ Tech Stack
